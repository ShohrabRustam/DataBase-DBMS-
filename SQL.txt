Explain Whats SQL is

Outline the role of SQL in database

CRUD OPERATIONS: CREATE, READ , UPDATE, DELETE

SQL : Standard language that can interact with structured data on databases.

SQL and relational databases:
    MySQL
    PostgreSQL
    Oracle
    Microsoft SQL server

Database Management System (DBMS/DMS):
    Changes SQL instructions into a from understood by the database.


Explain common SQL tasks
Understanding SQL subset & sublanguages

SQL subset:
        Data defination languages (DDL):
           create command:- Used to create storage objects in a database like tables.
           Alter command:- Modify the structure of a table objects in a database.
           DROP command:- Remove an existing object from a database.

        Data manipulation languages (DML): DMS is used to manipulate data in the database like inserting, updating, or deleting (CURD).
        
        Data Query languages (DQL): DQL define the select command to retrieve data from the database.
        
        Data control languages (DCL): DCL to control access to the database. 
        Grant access to the database and revoke DDL commands are used to give user access privileges to 
        the database & revert privileges access already given to the users.



Identify the advantage of the SQL

Demonstrate how the advantages of SQL assist with database tasks 

    Advantages:
        
        User Friendly : SQL requires very little coding skills to use.
        
        Standard language: Compatible with all available relational databases.

        Portable language: SQL can be used on any hardware running any operating system or any platforms.
        
        Manage database Security

        Data processing : SQL processes large amount of data quickly and efficiently.
