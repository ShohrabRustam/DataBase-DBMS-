Explain Whats SQL is

Outline the role of SQL in database

CRUD OPERATIONS: CREATE, READ , UPDATE, DELETE

SQL : Standard language that can interact with structured data on databases.

SQL and relational databases:
    MySQL
    PostgreSQL
    Oracle
    Microsoft SQL server

Database Management System (DBMS/DMS):
    Changes SQL instructions into a from understood by the database.


Explain common SQL tasks
Understanding SQL subset & sublanguages

SQL subset:
        Data defination languages (DDL):
           create command:- Used to create storage objects in a database like tables.
           Alter command:- Modify the structure of a table objects in a database.
           DROP command:- Remove an existing object from a database.

        Data Manipulation Languages (DML): DMS is used to manipulate data in the database like inserting, updating, or deleting (CURD).
        
        Data Query Languages (DQL): DQL define the select command to retrieve data from the database.
        
        Data control Languages (DCL): DCL to control access to the database. 
        Grant access to the database and revoke DDL commands are used to give user access privileges to 
        the database & revert privileges access already given to the users.



Identify the advantage of the SQL

Demonstrate how the advantages of SQL assist with database tasks 

    Advantages:
        
        User Friendly : SQL requires very little coding skills to use.
        
        Standard language: Compatible with all available relational databases.

        Portable language: SQL can be used on any hardware running any operating system or any platforms.
        
        Manage database Security

        Data processing : SQL processes large amount of data quickly and efficiently.


Create a database and tables using the (Data Defination Language) DDL subset of the SQL database.

Utillize the (Data Manipulation Language)DML subset of the SQL database to populate and Modify the data in the database.

Reading and query data within databases using the (Data Query Language)DQL subset of the SQL database.
