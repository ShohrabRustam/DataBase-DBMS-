Database Constraints: Limit the type of data that can be stored in a table.
                        This ensures that the data into the database is correct and reliable.

NOT NULL Constraints: ensures data field never left blank.

    CREATE TABLE USER (
        customer_id INT NOT NULL,
        customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    );
